About
----------------

This is a remake of Bejeweled game in Javascript. I used the Crafty.js game engine.


Status
----------------

The game is not playable. All it does so far is generate a random puzzle (free from matches) and move pieces.


ToDo
----------------

It's somehow in the right order to. :)

 ~> Make the mechanics work. When you match at least three equal pieces, the game should destroy them and 'spawn' new ones
 ~> Write an algorithm to validate whether there's solution to the puzzle or not
 ~> Add a counter which decreases on time but increases when you make a match
 ~> Make better graphics, animation, etc...
